Description: Defines the files and packages for a minimal Mendel install
 This package contains the initial "run once" scripts that perform
 initial startup work such as resizing the root filesystem to match the emmc
 size, adding in known users, enabling services that users will likely want by
 default, and other housekeeping behaviors (such as forcing a regeneration of
 ssh host keys).
 .
 This package actually contains the runonce scripts that do the above. Like the
 runonce package, removing this one should have little effect on a running
 system that has executed those scripts already.
