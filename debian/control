Description: Performs initial system setup work
 This package contains the initial "run once" systemd service that performs
 initial startup work such as resizing the root filesystem to match the emmc
 size, adding in known users, enabling services that users will likely want by
 default, and other housekeeping behaviors (such as forcing a regeneration of
 ssh host keys).
 . 
 This package is mostly empty, save for the runonce systemd service, so
 removing it should have little effect on a running system.
